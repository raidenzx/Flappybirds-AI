# 🐦 FlappyBirds AI

This project implements an AI for the classic FlappyBirds game. It uses **pyGame** for game simulation and **NEAT** for evolving neural networks. The main goal is to explore artificial intelligence concepts through practical application.

## ✨ Features

- Simulates the FlappyBirds game using pyGame.
- Evolves neural networks using NEAT to control the game.
- Generates dynamic obstacles with random behavior.
- Provides an interactive environment to learn about AI.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [pyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) — game development framework
- **os** — system operations
- **random** — random number generation
- [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/) — neuroevolution of augmenting topologies

## 📋 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappybirds-ai.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pygame neat-python
   ```

3. **Run the project:**

   ```bash
   python flappybirds_ai.py
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project was developed primarily as an educational tool to understand artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms. It offers a hands-on experience in training neural networks to solve dynamic, real-time challenges.
