{"name": "FlappyBirds_AI_Readme", "type": "document", "content": "# FlappyBirds AI\n\nThis project implements an AI for the classic FlappyBirds game. It uses pyGame for game simulation and NEAT for evolving neural networks. The main goal is to explore artificial intelligence concepts through practical application.\n\n## âœ¨ Features\n\n- Simulates the FlappyBirds game using pyGame.\n- Evolves neural networks using NEAT to control the game.\n- Generates dynamic obstacles with random behavior.\n- Provides an interactive environment to learn about AI.\n\n## ðŸ›  Technologies Used\n\n- pyGame â€” game development framework\n- os â€” system operations\n- random â€” random number generation\n- NEAT â€” neuroevolution of augmenting topologies\n\n## ðŸ“‹ How to Use\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n bash\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/flappybirds-ai.git\n \n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n bash\npip install pygame neat-python\n \n\n3. Run the project:\n\n bash\npython flappybirds_ai.py\n \n\n## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes\n\nThis project was developed primarily as an educational tool to understand artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms. It offers a hands-on experience in training neural networks to solve dynamic, real-time challenges.\n\n<!-- Suggestion 1: Adjust the introduction to emphasize the educational objectives further if needed. -->\n<!-- Suggestion 2: Consider adding a section on customization tips and training parameters. -->\n<!-- Suggestion 3: A demo video or GIF can enhance the presentation of the project. -->\n<!-- Suggestion 4: Check if additional system requirements or configuration details are necessary. -->"}
